Practice speaking any language with Echo, the app that lets you hear your voice and native speakers next to each other.

================

* The Pimsleur Method is the most effective way to learn a language. Echo takes the most important part, repetitive speaking, and puts it into a fun and useful app.

* Download lessons created by native speakers of the language you are learning.

* "How do I say" feature... try to say a word and ask for help. Help other people who are learning your native language.

* Pass your language tests (TOEFL, ESL, AP Spanish) with effective practice. Do better than classmates who practice with other L2 learners.
