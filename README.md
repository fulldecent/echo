# Echo

Hear yourself  and native speakers  to improve pronunciation.

Language practice / speech pathology / accent reduction

## Purpose

This app can help you improve pronunciation. Whether that is for speech pathology, accent reduction or studying a new language. It is extremely effective. This app does not intend to teach you all the vocabulary you need, it is not a language app, it is a pronunciation app.

See also my other app for speech pathology: https://github.com/fulldecent/formant-analyzer

## Intro

This iOS app provides the same functionality as the website https://learnwithecho.com.

It is my first serious iOS app and has gone through siginificant development over the years. It has been successful and brought in good money since 2008 or so, and I hope you can study it for your own benefit or to contribute improvements.
