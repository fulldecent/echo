Hello, 

I am William Entriken and have developed the app Echo to practice word pronunciation for people learning languages. Originally I started this to learn programming and help my girlfriend who is Chinese and has trouble with certain English words after being in the US for several years. Now we are adding Spanish and Chinese lessons. There's also a basic website at https://learnwithecho.com

Just wanted to reach out in case this would be of any value for your audience. Following are promo codes to download for free.

Hello, I am developing an iPhone application for people to supplement their language studies. This app allows people to listen to a teacher, record their own voice, then listen over and over. It is good for intermediate-level learners. This is a great way for language teachers to meet students. This app costs $4 in the App store, but below are free codes. You can use the App store and click "Redeem" to try this for free.

I am writing to ask if you would be interested in a type of partnership. You could create lessons in any language on this app. This is very easy and fast to do. Then you would set list your username as myplt.com. I will market this app to people studying any language and hope some of these become your customers. I have developed this app for my girlfriend who speaks English as a second language to help her practice words she has trouble with. And I do wish to help anyone that wants to learn a new language.

ADD TOKENS

Thank you,
Will
